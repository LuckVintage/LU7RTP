# LU7 RTP Minecraft Plugin

LU7 RTP is a Minecraft 1.20 Plugin that allows players to use the command ``/rtp`` to teleport to a random location. This plugin was primarily created for use on a private survival server. While I don't plan to actively maintain this plugin, the code is available for anyone to use. Pull requests are welcomed.
